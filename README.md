# Universal Fashion Ontology and Feature Extraction System

## Overview
The **Universal Fashion Ontology and Feature Extraction System** is designed to handle multi-modal fashion data and extract relevant features from textual and visual sources. This system aims to understand contextual nuances and adapt to evolving fashion trends by creating an ontology and leveraging advanced feature extraction techniques. The project integrates machine learning models to provide improved fashion product recommendations and categorization.

### Set up Google Drive integration

Since the project requires access to a dataset stored on Google Drive, follow these steps:
1. Mount Google Drive using the code provided in the notebook or script:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
2. Ensure your dataset is located at `/content/drive/MyDrive/dataset` (or update the paths in the code accordingly).

## Features
- **Multi-modal Data Handling:** The system integrates both image and textual data for feature extraction and recommendations.
- **Fashion Ontology:** A comprehensive representation of fashion concepts, styles, and attributes, allowing for improved product categorization.
- **Trend Adaptation:** Uses continuous learning to adapt to emerging fashion trends.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides fashion suggestions based on user preferences, improving customer experience.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to handle large datasets and can be deployed for large-scale commercial applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.12**
- **PyTorch** for deep learning model development (ResNet18 for feature extraction)
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning tasks
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation and processing
- **Google Colab** for cloud-based development and access to GPU
- **TensorFlow** for certain deep learning models (if used in further versions)
- **Google Drive API** for data access and storage

## Model

The primary model used in this project for feature extraction is **ResNet18**, a deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. The model is fine-tuned on fashion product data to learn high-level features from both images and text descriptions. These features are then integrated into the recommendation system.

The model pipeline includes:
- **Image Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization and embedding of text data.
- **Feature Fusion:** Combining image and text features into a unified vector for improved prediction accuracy.

## Methodology

The system is based on several key components:
1. **Ontology Creation:** We define a comprehensive ontology for fashion products, categorizing attributes such as style, color, material, brand, and more.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Both image and textual features are extracted using deep learning techniques, with ResNet18 used for visual features and a custom text embedding model for product descriptions.
3. **Multi-modal Integration:** The features from both sources are combined, forming a unified representation of each product for improved classification and recommendation.
4. **Model Training:** We train machine learning models, including classification models and recommendation engines, to predict trends and personalize suggestions.
5. **Continuous Learning:** The system is designed to adapt and learn from new data, ensuring that it stays relevant to evolving fashion trends.
